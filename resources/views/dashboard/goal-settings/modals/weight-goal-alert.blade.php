            We recommend that you set a realistic weight loss goal. Don’t make it too low and don’t 
            make it too high. We recommend that you should not exceed more than 1.5 kg/week. This is because 
            there are lot of factors that affect your ability to lose weight as planned. Setting a very high target for 
            weight loss may put your body under undue stress. It also makes it difficult for you to build 
            healthy habits that will enable you sustain this weight loss for the rest of your life.
